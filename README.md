# Abstract-class-example
An example of an abstract class Network with userName fields, password and three abstract methods. The method void post (String message) logs the user and if login is successful, sends a message and logs out the user. Two classes that inherit from the Network class: Facebook and Twitter implement abstract methods of the base class.
